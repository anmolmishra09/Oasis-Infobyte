## 🚀 Projects Completed

### Project 1: [Voice Assistant]
- **Description**: Brief description of what the project does
- **Technologies**: Python, [SST/pyttsx3]
- **Key Features**: 
  - Converts speech to text, processes commands, and responds with synthesized speech
  - Interprets user intent and context to provide relevant, conversational responses
  - Executes practical actions like setting reminders, answering questions, or controlling smart devices

### Project 2: [BMI Calculator]
- **Description**: Brief description of what the project does
- **Technologies**: Python, [tkinter]
- **Key Features**: 
  - Calculates BMI from height/weight inputs and categorizes results
  - Accepts measurements in different units (metric: kg/cm vs imperial: lbs/ft-in) with automatic conversion
  - Provides personalized health advice, ideal weight ranges, and actionable fitness/nutrition tips based on BMI results

### Project 3: [Random Password Generator]
- **Description**: Brief description of what the project does
- **Technologies**: Python, [string/tkinter (Python) - Desktop applications]
- **Key Features**: 
  - Allows users to set password length, include/exclude character types (uppercase, lowercase, numbers, symbols), and avoid ambiguous characters
  - Evaluates password security level, checks against common patterns, and ensures generated passwords meet specified complexity requirements
  - Uses cryptographically secure randomization, provides copy-to-clipboard functionality, and optionally saves passwords securely or generates multiple passwords at once

### Project 4: [Basic Weather App]
- **Description**: Brief description of what the project does
- **Technologies**: Python, [requests]
- **Key Features**: 
  - Shows real-time temperature, weather conditions, humidity, wind speed, and weather icons for the user's location or searched city
  - Automatically detects user's current location via GPS or allows manual city search with auto-complete suggestions
  - Provides 5-7 day weather outlook with daily highs/lows, precipitation chances, and weather condition summaries

### Project 5: [Chat Application]
- **Description**: Brief description of what the project does
- **Technologies**: Python, [Socket.IO]
- **Key Features**: 
  - Instant message delivery and receipt with live typing indicators, message status (sent/delivered/read), and seamless conversation flow
  - Secure login/registration system, user profiles, contact lists, and privacy controls for blocking/reporting users
  - Create group conversations, share images/files/documents, and manage group members with admin controls and notifications
